# Web-guesser-Sinatra
Jumpstartlab Webguesser project from Odin project rails track

By using sinatra I learned how to:

* Set up a basic route: get '/' do ... end
* Link a route to a view: erb :index
* Acquire local parameters and embed them into the views: locals => {:key_to_refer => value }

From [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-basics) following a [Jumpstart tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html).
